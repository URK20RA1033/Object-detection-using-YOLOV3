# Object-detection-using-YOLOV3

A real-time object detection system called YOLOv3 (You Only Look Once, Version 3) recognises particular things in films, live feeds, or still photos. It is a CNN-based method that accurately detects objects in real time using a single neural network architecture.  

**REQUIREMENTS:**

a. Pycharm (compiler)<br />
b. Open cv(library)<br />
c. Numpy(library)<br />
d. Camera(laptop or external)<br />

**Datasets:**

There are three types of datasets has been used

a) Yolov3.weights<br />
b) Yolov3.cfg<br />
c) Coco. Names<br />

The model is trained using ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK.Under Supervised learning. These datasets consist of the configuration, Training weights and the classes under the name of COCO. NAMES which has 80 trained class for object detection.
